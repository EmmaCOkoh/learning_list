# Lists – Holding Many Things!

Today, I learned how to use **lists** in Python to keep many things together — like a backpack.

---

## I Learned:

- How to make a list using `[ ]`
- How to get one item using its number (called index)
- How to add and remove things from a list
- How to go through a list using a loop

---

## What I Practiced:

- Creating a list of names
- Printing just one item from the list
- Adding and removing items
- Looping through all items
- Doing math with list numbers

---

## Portfolio Project:

I built a tiny **To-Do List App** that:
- Shows what to do
- Adds a new task
- Removes a done task
- Prints what’s left
